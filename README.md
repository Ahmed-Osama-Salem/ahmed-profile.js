My name is Ahmed Osama Salem, I’ve held the Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering department in 2019, I’ve finished my military service in 2021, I worked as a site engineer for 6 months and I finally gave up to start my new career as a programmer focusing on developing the front-end websites using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript fundamentals with ES6 knowledge and OOP, I love programming with all of my heart, I love creating something different and special, with a line of code you can change the world!! I always strive to develop myself in programming in general, not only in the web field, and always my motto in life is that knowledge has no limitation.
